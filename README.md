# Either-Type-DotNet
Either&lt;...> is a structure that can hold one value of many types. Unlike .Net `System.Object` type that can hold any value this type will not box the type. It also allows you to know what type it has inside it, do pattern matching, and use it with other frameworks like Json.Net, and I hope in the future ORMs.
